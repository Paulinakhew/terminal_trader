# terminal_trader
To run Terminal Trader on your computer, download all the files. In your terminal, type in "python3 controller.py" and then create your own account! Make sure that you download trade_information.db or else your information will not be stored in the SQLite3 database. Alternatively, you can deleted the database, run schema.py and then run seed.py. This will result in a clean table.
